        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> &emsp; This project helps in Identification of the Offenders that may lead to
            accidents and help the Regulating Authority to Enforce the laws not avoid the
            accidents. As they say Prevention is Better than Cure i.e. If we can Enforce
            the laws and reduce the Offenders on the Road the Safety Increases
            Automatically. Such systems already developed but are either non-reliant, prone
            to errors or not very user-friendly which is the need of the hour. All these
            systems were isolated from each other and required a lot of man-power to
            maintain and use.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; Hence, as an improvement to the already developed technology this
            project based improves on the major aspects like low maintenance, user-friendly
            and main improvement is the connectivity to each other and the “Central
            Database”.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; This project focuses on the Road Safety and also the ease-of-access
            which is the need of the hour as increasing reliant on human resources is costly
            and prone to error. Hence, we will be targeting the areas listed below.
        </p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Areas of Concern:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reliability</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Low Maintenance</li>
            <li>Connectivity</li>
            <li>User Friendly</li>
            <li>User Friendly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project will be successor to present day Road Safety Technology in many
            ways.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As we can see in the figure 1, the total components are limited to 4 those are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arduino Uno x1</li>
            <li>IR Sensors x2</li>
            <li>Power Supply x1</li>
            <li>Solar Panel (optional) x1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These Components together from an Intelligent Road Safety Checker Device
            which will check if the vehicle passing by is adhering to the local Traffic Safety
            Rules or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many Rules applied by the government in various like One Way,
            Speed Limit, Traffic lights and Proper Parking
        </p>
        <p>
            This device can be Reprogrammed to be applicable to work in various scenario
            and linked to a central database where only the authorised person can access the
            data within it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each and every Kit will be wirelessly interconnected with each kit working as a
            node.
