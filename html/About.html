            “India has one of the worst Road Safety in the world” <sup>[2]</sup>. A statement
            made by an Article on World Resources Institute, 2019 <sup>[2]</sup>. India accounts for
            149,000 deaths out of 1.35 million deaths in World i.e. 11% of the total deaths
            even though India accounts for only 2% to total number of vehicles on road in
            the World <sup>[1]</sup>. Government of India has made many moves on increasing the
            Road Safety in India by bringing new laws or Amending the existing ones, but
            still road accidents and deaths are increasing year by year. So, with government
            doing its job it’s up to the people of India to adhere to the proper Road Safety
            Laws. This idea is proposed to regulate the laws to more remote areas and
            help the Authorities to identify the offenders and maintain the Road Safety
            Regulations.</p>
